This repository aims to provide simple and effective solutions to fundamental problems involving arrays and lists. Each problem is accompanied by a solution implemented in Python, focusing on clarity and efficiency.

## Problems Covered

Here is a list of problems currently included in this repository:

1. **Sum of All Elements**: Calculate the sum of all elements in a list of integers.
2. **Maximum Element**: Find the maximum element in a list of integers.
3. **Minimum Element**: Find the minimum element in a list of integers.
4. **Reverse List**: Reverse the elements of a list.
5. **Check Palindrome**: Check if a given list is a palindrome.
6. **Count Occurrences**: Count the occurrences of a specific element in a list.
7. **Merge Lists**: Merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
8. **Remove Duplicates**: Remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order.

... (add more problems as per your repository content)

## File Structure

- Each problem is implemented in its own Python file (`problem_name.py`).
- Solutions are designed to be simple, with explanations included as comments within the code.

## Usage

To use this repository:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python files (`sumAllElement.py`, etc.).
3. Open any file to view the problem statement and its corresponding solution.

## Example

For example, to find the sum of all elements in a list (`sumAllElement.py`):

```python {"id":"01J21EM1CF5Y24V6NGETR1ZJNC"}
def total_sum(values):
    return sum(values)

values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(total_sum(values))  # Output: 55
```
